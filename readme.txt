Thank you for downloading my 100% bug free (no guarantees) (no refunds) nfc tester. 

Here's how to use it. 

The app tries to find a reader and a card once its started. You can also click refresh to, you know refresh the app.
You can also write or delete any information on the card.
Delete automatically deletes everything in the card next time the app is refreshed.
Refresh automatically works sometimes. At the moment its on a three second timer, but if all the commands haven't finished the infromation displayed will likely be wrong.

==================================================================================================

The app should recognize the following tag types:
NTAG 203,213,215,216

Mifare Ultralight, Ultralight EV1 (virtually the same as the other ultralight), 1k, 4k, and MINI.
